# Theme Generator

*(Experimental)* plugin that generates random website theme using Bootstrap. [Live Demo](https://matronator.github.io/ThemeGenerator/)

## Features

- [x] Generate random theme (colors, font sizes, margins/paddings, top nav position)
- [x] Customize font weights (header title, section title, top menu)
- [x] Choose which font to use in what part of the page (headings, paragraphs, top menu)
  - Currently there are these fonts to choose from:
    * Bootstrap default
    * Montserrat
    * Raleway
    * Roboto
- [ ] Expand the customization panel to cover everything on the page
- [ ] Export generated style as CSS/SCSS file
- [ ] Can't think of anything else right now, to be continued...
